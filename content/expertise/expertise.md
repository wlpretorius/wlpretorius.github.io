<h2><u>A-IRB Probability of Default (PD)</u></h2>

## A-IRB Probability of Default (PD)

I focused in the full model development lifecycle, including:

- **Definition of Default (DoD) and Obligor Definition**: 
This includes an investigation on the triggers for DoD and changes over the historical period, on the received modelling and application dataset.

- **Single-Factor Analysis (SFA)**: 
This includes univariate and bivariate analysis on obligor level for each individual risk driver (independent variables used in the PD model). 

- **Multi-Factor Analysis (MFA)**: 
This includes risk driver selection as well as model selection. Typically this is a stagewise logistic regression model that is standard across Europe. 

- **Calibration**:
This includes a deep analysis of the calibration function (typically a bayesian scalar adjustment) used for the Long-run Average (LRA). Additionally, a deep investigation on the likely range of variability (as part of a representativity analysis) of the Observed Default Rates (ODRs) which includes the assessment of the good and bad years as required by Paragraph 82 to 86 in the EBA PD, LGD Estimation guidelines (this has been highly scrutinized in the past IMIs, which are investigations by the ECB, at Rabobank and different banks in the Netherlands). Calibration on segment level and a specific analysis per segment. 

- **Appropriate Adjustments (AA) and Margin of Conservatism (MoCs)**:
Adding any AAs and MoCs to the ODRs and LRA (the analysis in the likely range of variability assesses the AA that needs top be added to the LRA for a conservative manner to include all appropriate good and bad years in the historical observation period). 

- **Testing**: 
This includes model performance, segmentation and sensitivity testing. 

- **Business and Risk Expert Sessions**: 
This includes expert sessions with the Business and Risk Management after each of the above phase. I led multiple sessions at Rabobank.
