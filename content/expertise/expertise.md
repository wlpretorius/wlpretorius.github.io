## A-IRB Probability of Default (PD)

I focused on the full model development lifecycle (this includes writing code in Python) as well as designing and updating internal model procedures, including:

- **Definition of Default (DoD) and Obligor Definition**: 
This includes an investigation on the triggers for DoD and changes over the historical period, on the received modelling and application dataset.

- **Single-Factor Analysis (SFA)**: 
This includes univariate and bivariate analysis on obligor level for each individual risk driver (independent variables used in the PD model). 

- **Multi-Factor Analysis (MFA)**: 
This includes risk driver selection as well as model selection. Typically this is a stagewise logistic regression model that is standard across Europe. Additional assessment was done on the model assumptions and statistical assumptions and if they have been met.

- **Calibration**:
This includes a deep analysis of the calibration function (typically a bayesian scalar adjustment) used for the Long-run Average (LRA) and Masterscale mapping. Additionally, a deep investigation on the likely range of variability (as part of a representativity analysis - and the linkage with LGD economic downturn) of the Observed Default Rates (ODRs) which includes the assessment of the good and bad years as required by Paragraph 82 to 86 in the EBA PD, LGD Estimation guidelines (this has been highly scrutinized in the past IMIs, which are investigations by the ECB, at Rabobank and different banks in the Netherlands). Calibration on segment level and a specific analysis per segment was done. 

- **Appropriate Adjustments (AAs) and Margin of Conservatism (MoCs)**:
Adding any AAs and MoCs to the ODRs and LRA (the analysis in the likely range of variability assesses the AA that needs top be added to the LRA for a conservative manner to include all appropriate good and bad years in the historical observation period). 

- **Testing**: 
This includes model performance and accuracy (differentiation and quantification), segmentation and sensitivity testing. 

- **Business, Risk Experts and Validation Sessions**: 
This includes expert sessions with the Business and Risk Management (I led multiple sessions at Rabobank over 5 countries namely Australia, New-Zealand, Chile, Brazil and USA) after each of the above phase as well as a period of model validation investigations and model validation findings investigations.

- **Documentation**: 
Created high quality model development code and documentation where I automated the documentation process in Rabobank through a Python program with the use of JupyterBooks and Markdown. This saved significant time in the development phase and preparation for the model validation phase and IMI.  

- **Model Development Procedures**: 
Contributed to the development procedures for PD modelling methodologies as well as incorporating external and internal business and regulatory requirements into the PD modelling framework of Rabobank. 
Translated regulations (and COVID-19 policies) into quantitative & qualitative procedures that are used by modellers throughout the bank. These procedures are used as guidelines in future model (re)-development at Rabobank. 
Additionally, directly consulted to modellers regarding A-IRB regulation and assisted with on-site IMIs from the ECB (Rabobank IPRE portfolio). As part of the internal model development procedure updates, I conducted an investigation on the Gini coefficient as a discriminatory power statistic for risk differentiation in Rabobank.
I designed a confidence interval framework with a traffic lights system around the Gini Coefficient taking into consideration type 1 and 2 errors using Bootstrapping that could assist business decisions on model selection and performance. The findings and method were added in the Rabobank credit monitoring python library and procedures.

- **What I would like to additionally work on in the future**: 
Obligor (and joint-obligor) definition and construction. Machine learning challenger models in the MFA phase.
