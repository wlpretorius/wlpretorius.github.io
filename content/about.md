Hello and welcome! I'm Willem Pretorius, deeply involved in the evolving world of credit analytics at Rabobank Netherlands. My foundation is built on an MCom in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, which kick-started my adventure in the complex realm of credit risk modelling.

At Rabobank, I'm at the forefront of developing A-IRB PD, LGD, and EAD models, particularly focusing on the Agricultural portfolio. My role revolves around not just applying what I've learned about PD, LGD, EAD, IFRS9, and Stress Testing models, but also constantly expanding my knowledge and understanding. Working previously within the Methodology & Strategy team, I had the unique opportunity to untangle the complexities of A-IRB, IFRS9, and Stress Testing methodologies, making them more accessible for practical model development.

Before Rabobank, my role as a Quantitative Developer at ABSA Group Limited (previously Barclays Africa) honed my proficiency in multiple coding languages, setting the stage for innovative financial engineering solutions. At Riskworx, I contributed significantly to product development, model validation, and risk analytics, serving clients like the Development Finance Company of Uganda Bank Limited.

My journey in the field is marked by continuous learning and adaptation. My expertise isn't just confined to model development; I've led the charge in model testing, stakeholder management, and regulatory compliance, ensuring our models withstand scrutiny and drive strategic decision-making. Deep dives into Python for model development, monitoring, and stress testing have further solidified my reputation as a problem-solver and innovator in the field.
