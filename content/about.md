Welcome! I'm Willem Pretorius, a seasoned Credit Model Developer currently shaping the future of credit analytics at Rabobank Netherlands. With a robust academic background holding an MCom in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, my professional journey weaves through the intricate world of credit risk modelling.

At Rabobank, I spearhead the development of A-IRB PD, LGD, and EAD models with a specialized focus on the Agricultural portfolio, leveraging my deep experience across PD, LGD, EAD, IFRS9, and Stress Testing models. My previous tenure in the Methodology & Strategy team saw me demystifying A-IRB, IFRS9, and Stress Testing methodologies, bridging the gap between complex regulations and practical model development.

Before Rabobank, my role as a Quantitative Developer at ABSA Group Limited (previously Barclays Africa) honed my proficiency in multiple coding languages, setting the stage for innovative financial engineering solutions. At Riskworx, I contributed significantly to product development, model validation, and risk analytics, serving prestigious clients like the Development Finance Company of Uganda Bank Limited.

My expertise isn't just confined to model development; I've led the charge in model testing, stakeholder management, and regulatory compliance, ensuring our models withstand scrutiny and drive strategic decision-making. Deep dives into Python for model development, monitoring, and stress testing have further solidified my reputation as a problem-solver and innovator in the field.
